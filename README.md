# Goal

Train models that can determine whether artworks are ascribable Leonardo Da Vinci. Specifically, train an encoder to represent features from a variety of pieces, and then fine-tune a head to distinguish between Da Vinci and non-Da Vinci works.

# Motivation

I am a big fan of Isaacson biographies, having read Steve Jobs and half of Einstein and Da Vinci. Currently I'm roughing it through Da Vinci as it is very dense but educational nonetheless. I find it fascinating that a couple works were attributed to Da Vinci several hundred years posthumously due to improper initial examination, leading to increbile arbitrage opportunities for those with proper discernment. The most prominent examples are `Salvatore Mundi` and `La Bella Principessa`.
