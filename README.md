# Goal

Train models that can determine whether or not images belong to works of Leonardo Da Vinci. Specifically, train an encoder to represent all kinds of artworks, and then fine-tune a head to distinguish between Da Vinci and non-Da Vinci works.

# Motivation

There are lots of 'experts' who think they know whether or not a work belongs to Da Vinci, but are frequently wrong because they make their determinations based on vibes. 

There have also been several times that art works were determined to be by Da Vinci several hundred years after his death because they were not properly examined, leading to a big arbitrage opportunity for those who did properly attribute the works to Da Vinci. The most prominent examples include:

- Salvatore Mundi
- La Bella Principessa
